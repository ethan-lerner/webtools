            <p>
                Hi there, my name is Ethan and this is my website. I am a second year student at Dallas College,
                specifically Richland, and am studying Software Development. I was initially interested in mechanical
                engineering out of high school but decided that it wasn't the career for me and switched into computer
                science, specifically software development, where I discovered just how much I love coding and programming!
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of high school, I
                attended Richardson High School and was in the robotics magnet there. Don't let the name of that magnet
                fool you as it was less robotics as it was manufacturing, much to my disappointment. Despite my
                expectations being a little let down, the magnet was still very valuable as it helped to shape the way I
                view problems presented to me, and as such, when I am presented with a problem I attempt to break it
                down into managable pieces as to not overwhelm myself and mke the issue worse.
