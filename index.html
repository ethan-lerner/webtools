    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>Hi there, my name is Ethan and this is my website. I don't have much experience with writing code but I hope that this website can help provide a space to present my learning progress. So far I'm having fun with this process and am looking forward to the rest of the semester.</p>
