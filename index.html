            <p>
                I would say that my "Developer Identity" is still being fleshed out simply because I still don't have
                much experience with programming as a whole. At the time of writing I have only taken one true
                programming class, that being Programming Logic and Design. My thought process when approaching
                programming is definitely one of hesitancy based purely on inexperience, however, as I said above, I
                like to break down problems presented to me into pieces to give myself a broader view of what is being
                asked of me.

                <em>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</em> A quote that i try to live by in
                my development process as, in my eyes, any progress is better than no progress. Even if you have to go
                back later and change what you added or fully delete your progress, you still made that first step and
                put something down.

            <p>
                My journey into programming has definitely been a long and winding one as this path was not what I
                started down. As stated above, I started down the path of mechanical engineering and even attended a
                full yaer of schooling with mechanical engineering as my major. Clearly that school and major did not
                turn out otherwise I would not be writing this and you would not be reading this.

            <p>
                After that year I took
                a gap year to kind of figure out what exactly I wanted to do. I took a couple online classes that ended
                up going nowhere but got me interested in programming as a whole so I decided that I had been sitting
                doing nothing for long enough and enrolled for some classes at Dallas College. It was definitely
                daunting to go back to school but it was a good change for me as it provided structure to an otherwise
                unstructured day.
